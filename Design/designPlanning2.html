        The aesthetic that I'm looking to emulate has a clean cut style. It's one that mimics the OS' of video game consoles like the Nintendo Wii or the Wii U.

            General placement of icons and buttons

    <h3>
        Colour swatches:
    </h3>
 
    <p>
        The colours that I have thought to use are as follows:
    </p>
    <section>
        <h4>
            White
        </h4>
        <img src = "../images/IxDProcessImages/white.png" width = "200" height = "100">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Hex code: #FFFFFF
            </li>
            <li>
                Mainly used for backgrounds or accents
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    
  <section>
    <h4>
        Grey
    </h4>
    <img src = "../images/IxDProcessImages/grey.png" width = "200" height = "100">
   <ul>
    <li>
        Hex code: #D9D9D9

        Secondary colour for backgrounds

            Hex code: #FF5757

    <h3>
        Font samples:
    </h3>

    <p>
        I'm quite fond of the font Horizon from Canva for my headings, and the font Anonymous Pro from Canva for my body text.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Horizon:
    </h4>
    <img src = "../images/IxDProcessImages/font1.png" width = "250" height = "50">

    <h4>
        Anonymous Pro:
    </h4>
    <img src = "../images/IxDProcessImages/font2.png" width = "150" height = "50">
<p>
    I like these because they have a clean and simple design, and I'd argue that they have good readability. If these fonts are not available, I will try to find google fonts that look the closest to these.

    <h3>
        Design sketches and explanations:
    </h3>
    <p>
        Homepage sketch
    </p>
    <img src = "../images/Homepage.png" width = "400" height = "200">
    <p>
        For the homepage, each section would be interactable. Clicking on each of the buttons displayed would take the user to the corresponding page.
    </p>

<p>
    Blog homepage sketch:
</p>
<img src = "../images/Blog Section.png" width = "400" height = "200">
<p>
    The blog pages would function very similarly to the design pages. Users would click on which blog that they would want to view, and then that would take them to that blog's specific page.
</p>
<h3>
    Design homepage skecth:
</h3>
<img src = "../images/Design Section.png" width = "400" height = "200">
<p>
    The design section has changed a bit, rather than accessing this page and the scrolling through all of the designs, designs will be broken up into two sections: general design and IxD Process. Users would click on the section that they desire, and then be able to view the designs on those pages.
</p>

<h3>
    Portfolio and Profile homepage sketch:
</h3>
<img src = "../images/Profile and Portfolio Page.png" width = "400" height = "200">
<p>
    The profile and portfolio section would function the same too.  
</p>
<h3>
    Essay homepage sketch:
</h3>
<img src = "../images/Essay Section.png" width = "400" height = "200">
<p>
    The essay section would function exactly like how the blogs section functions.
