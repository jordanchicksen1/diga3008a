        Reflecting on Stuart Mouthrop text:
    
</h3>
</br>
<p>
    Stuart Mouthrop's text You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media (2003) critiques hypertext as a form of sharing digital information. Mouthrop's critique not necessarily correct, as the internet has become such a large space that it is a decentralized space, which is built off participatory knowledge creation. An example of a popular site that exemplifies these characteristics is Wikipedia. At the time that it was written, his critique could've been accurate, as less people knew how to create space on the internet. Those who knew the ins and outs on internet infrastructure were employed by corporations to create spaces for them. However, in this day and age, information about internet infrastructure is much more accessible to the average person, which has led to more people being able to create their own internet spaces. Mouthrop's text didn't consider that the users of hypermedia would learn and adapt to the system that they were interacting with.

        Wireframes for my website:
    
</h3>
<h4>
    Homepage
</h4>
</br>
<P>
    This will be my website's hub, it will allow the user to access the different pages. I want this to be as simple as possible, to not overwhelm the viewer, but still display everything the site has to offer.
</P>

    <h4>
        Blog Page
    </h4>
</br>
    <P>
        This page will display my blogs. Each blog will have a thumbnail and a small description about what the blog is about. When you click on the thumbnail, it will take you to that specific blog's page. There is also a home button that will take you to the homepage.
    </P>
    <img src = "../images/Blog Section.png" width = "300" height = "200" alt="Blog Page wireframe" class="lightboxPic">
    
    <h4>
        Essay Page
    </h4>
</br>
    <P>
        This page will display my essays, much like how my blogs will be displayed. Clicking the thumbnails for the essays will open that essays' page.
    </P>
    <img src = "../images/Essay Section.png" width = "300" height = "200" alt="Essay Section wireframe" class="lightboxPic" >

    <h4>
    Design Page
    </h4>
</br>
    <P>
        This will be split into two sections: Design and IxD Process. The design section will feature the work-in-progress snapshots of my website, specifically the visuals. The IxD Process section will feature my planning for the structure (how my pages are connected) of my site.
    </P>

    <h4>
        Profile and Porfolio Page
        </h4>
    </br>
        <P>
            This page will display information that I have on my LinkedIn page, and will display the games I have put on Itch.io.  For the games, if you click on the game's thumbnail, it will take you to that games' Itch page.
        </P>

<h4>
    Inspirational website
</h4>
</br>
<p>
    I like the way the <a href = "https://www.nintendo.com/en-za/Nintendo-eShop/Nintendo-eShop-1806894.html?srsltid=AfmBOooxp4isfewiM_o46HfXTpK2F5e5YEHvTWy1p7AqyDMGnP2MHj38">Nintendo eShop</a> is set up. It is a bit busy, but everything is accessible whenever you need it to be. You don't have to manuever all over pages to get to the place you're looking for.
</p>

<h4>
    Interaction and the www:
</h4>
</br>
<p>
    Interaction to me is creating the conventions and space for your user to explore what you have created.  It is fundamental to the technology as a whole for me. Systems without the space for users, ones that are built to run without human interaction don't even feel like technology to me. The just feel like attributes of an environment, they blend in to the point where I almost don't even notice them. An example of this are streetlights.
