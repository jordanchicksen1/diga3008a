DECOLONIAL COMPUTING
</h2>
</br>
<p>
   After heaving learned about decolonial coding and development theories, it's clear that I have been coding and creating digital experiences that appeal to western sensibilities and not ones that cater towards global southern conventions. 
</p>
</br>

<p>
    When learning how to develop software, we try to create experiences that we've seen before. Due to all of the western media that we consume and learn from, its likely that we will be influenced by the western sensibilities that are inherent to that media. This can be seen in how I have made software that is only compatible with specific technologies and not all technologies. Specifically with games, the global south mostly interacts with games on mobile devices, since PCs and consoles are quite expensive. Making video games that are only accessible on PCs appeals to western sensibilities more, as those parts of the world have this technology at their fingertips. </p>
</br>

<p>
    In terms of actual coding practices, I have created systems that fall in line with how western systems are created. Navigational features like navbars are a common design practice that is used globally, but something like having blogs each on their own page is a system that is influenced by the west. I say this because it is not inclusive to make viewers access multiple pages to experience all of the content on my site, as it is not data-friendly for them to have to load multiple pages. 
</p>
</br>

<p>
    Having said this, I don't think that I will change this system, as it would require a lot of work and time (that I don't necessarily have right now) to rework. Also, this system allows me to understand and organize my work better. This sort of system is commonplace because it does work quite well, but I'm aware that this makes my site less inclusive. </p>

    MY PLANS FOR JAVASCRIPT
</h2>
</br>
<p>
    I plan on using Javascript mainly on my content pages (like my blogs, design sections and portfolio). I want to create a button that takes the user back to the top of the page, and buttons that let users cycle through pages easily (where applicable). This will make my site have better flow and increase the accessibility of different pages, so viewers will be able to navigate through my site with less clicks.
