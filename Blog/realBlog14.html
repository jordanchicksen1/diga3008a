JUSTICE AND ETHICS IN MY ART
</h2>
</br>
<p>
  Carefully considering how I construct my artworks is an essential step in the process. It's almost more important that the physical creation of the artwork itself or the end product of said artwork.
To make sure that any art that I create is upheld by morally correct principles, I must make sure to:
</p>
</br>

<h3 class = "longer">
1. THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATE THE TOPIC I WILL BE DISCUSSING THROUGH MY ART. 
</h3>
</br>
<p>
    To create art with an informed opinion, I must make sure to look at the topic that my art will explore through every angle I can, and choose the most morally correct lens to view that topic through. This will mitigate art creation that is ignorant. Thorough investigation could also help me see topics in a light that I hadn't seen them in before, which in turn, could help to make more interesting art too.
</p>
</br>
<h3 class = "longer">
2. ALWAYS CONSULT WITH OTHERS DURING THE CREATION PROCESS OF THIS ART.
</h3>
</br>
<p>
    Having many eyes on my work will help me to see mistakes or messages that I couldn't see before, as people will come to my art with new perspectives and educate me on things that were incorrect about my work. Its even better if people who know more about the topic that I'm working on give their opinions on my work, as it creates a learnable moment for me from an accurate source. 
</p>
</br>
<h3 class = "shorter">
    3. STAY IN MY LANE.
</h3>
</br>
<p>
    I shouldn't create art or display opinions on things that I can't relate to, just for the sake of it. For art to be meaningful, I should have a genuine connection for the things that I'm creating, as it will make me engage with the topic more and create better art in the process. If I don't have a connection to what I'm creating, I'm more likely to make something that is offensive to people in way that I was unaware of.
