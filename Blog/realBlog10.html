Research: Internet, Society and Design Justice

    Digital equality refers to the idea all people should have equal access to digital technology like the internet and all free apps, and the skillset required to use those technologies. Not being able to access the internet excludes that person/people from a large breadth of information, such as information that is relevant to digital platforms (like AI tools) but also information that impacts analogue world systems (such as online banking).

    Nanjira Sambuli details this topic in an interview with the World Economic Forum. This text is from 2019, and discusses actions that should've been taken to integrate more people into digital systems, specifically people in less developed areas. Sambuli explains that less developed areas experience systemic issues such as a lack of resources, and access to digital technologies is just another one of these resources. Solving digital inequalities requires us to solve the systemic issues of inequalities that are at the root of these problems. Sambuli also discusses making technologies more accessible by changing how funding models work within the tech industry. She states that setting up funding for teams to create solutions (platforms or apps) for a single issue doesn't work anymore, as consumers are accustomed to experiences that offer a breadth of options.

    Aside from actual access to digital technologies, these technologies can also be designed more inclusively. Digital technologies will have a positive impact on more people if they cater for more people. Sasha Costanza-Cook's text Design Justice: Community-Led Practices to Build the World We Need (2020) details how current normative design practices reiterate systemic issues that we face as a society, and that changing these design practices can afford marginalized groups a place of belonging. This can be done by making software design be community led. This follows the idea of "don't create something for us without us", which states that teams that are designing experiences for specific communities should have members of those communities on those teams.
