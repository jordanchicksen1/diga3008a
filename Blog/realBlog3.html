        WEEK 3
    </h1>

<h2 class = "shorter">
 Outlining key terms:
</h2>
<p>
Before beginning this discussion, it would be worthwhile to  outline the definitions of some of the key terms that will be used in this discussion.  
</p>
</br>
<h3 class = "shorter">
    Alignment
</h3>
<p>
    To articulate a goal in a succinct and simple way, and to make it achievable.
</p>
</br>
<h3 class="shorter">
    User:
</h3>
<p>
    A person who visits the site, who the site is made for. The target audience of the site.
</p>
</br>

<p>
    Therefore, user alignment would who would be visiting my site and what would they be doing.
</p>
<p>
    My users would hopefully be potential collaborators or employers. What those users would be able to do is view the art that I create, and be able to contact me regarding that art if they so please. 
</p>
<h2 class ="shorter">
    Mapping out my sites content:
</h2>
<h3 class = "shorter">
    Blogs 
</h3>
<p>
    These would be more informal thoughts, that are still carefully considered, but not pieces of writing that are mulled over endlessly. Shorter-form writing where I give my quick thoughts on any given topic.
</p>

<h3 class = "shorter">
    Essays 
</h3>
<p>
    Long-form writing that deals with my thoughts on interactive media, filled with carefully considered opinions and research on any given topic related to interactive media.
</p>

<h3 class = "shorter">
    Design
</h3>
<p>
    This will display my work-in-progress artworks and/or UI/UX visual updates for this website.
</p>
<h3 class = "shorter">
    Profile
</h3>
<p>
    This will display my contact information, education, attributes and work experience.
</p>
<h3 class = "shorter">
    Portfolio
</h3>
<p>
    This will display my released works, specifically my Itch.io page, and the things that I have put on there.
</p>
<p>
    Each of these sections will have their own folder, hub page and content pages.
