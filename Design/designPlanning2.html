        The aesthetic that I'm looking to emulate has a clean cut style. It's one that mimics the OS' of video game consoles like the Nintendo Wii or the Wii U. However, the text/content will mimic the designs of messaging applications like iMessage, as it will make it feel like I'm talking directly to my users through my site.

        What I'm taking away from my inspiration:
    </h3>
  <p class="filler">

  </p> 
   <p>
 Button and icon design, colour consistency, general placement of icons and buttons, and font styling. All of these influences have clear designs, that are almost minimalist in a sense. I like that, it allows for my structure and content to have more a focus. Complex designs could possibly make my site too busy.

        I'm quite fond of the font Horizon from Canva for my headings, and the font Anonymous Pro from Canva for my body text.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Horizon:
    </h4>
    <img src = "../images/IxDProcessImages/font1.png" width = "250" height = "50" alt="HORIZON FONT" class="lightboxPic">

    <h4>
        Anonymous Pro:
    </h4>

    <p class="filler">

    </p>
<p>
    I like these because they have a clean and simple design, and I'd argue that they have good readability. If these fonts are not available, I will try to find google fonts that look the closest to these.

        For the homepage, each section would be interactable. Clicking on each of the buttons displayed would take the user to the corresponding page.
    </p>

<h3 class = "shorter">
    Blog homepage sketch:
</h3>
<img src = "../images/Blog Section.png" width = "400" height = "200" alt="Blog Homepage wireframe" class="lightboxPic" >
<p class="filler">

</p>
<p>
    The blog pages would function very similarly to the design pages. Users would click on which blog that they would want to view, and then that would take them to that blog's specific page.
</p>
<h3 class = "shorter">
    Design homepage skecth:

<img src = "../images/Design Section.png" width = "400" height = "200"alt="Design Homepage wireframe" class="lightboxPic" >
<p class="filler">

</p>
<p>
    The design section has changed a bit, rather than accessing this page and the scrolling through all of the designs, designs will be broken up into two sections: general design and IxD Process. Users would click on the section that they desire, and then be able to view the designs on those pages.
</p>

<h3 class = "shorter">

</p>
<p>
    The profile and portfolio section would function the same too. This would keep the site consistent and clear, ensuring that users aren't confused about the layout.

    Essay homepage sketch:

<p>
    The essay section would function exactly like how the blogs section functions.This would keep the site consistent and clear, ensuring that users aren't confused about the layout.
