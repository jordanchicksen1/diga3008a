        The aesthetic that I'm looking to emulate has a clean cut style. It's one that mimics the OS' of video game consoles like the Nintendo Wii or the Wii U.

        The colours that I have thought to use are as follows:

    Font samples:
    
    I'm quite fond of the font Horizon from Canva for my headings, and the font Anonymous Pro from Canva for my body text.
    
    Horizon:
    
    font1.png
    
     
    
    Anonymous Pro:
    
    font2.png
    
    I like these because they have a clean and simple design, and I'd argue that they have good readability. If these fonts are not available, I will try to find google fonts that look the closest to these.

    Homepage-1.png
    
    For the homepage, each section would be interactable. Clicking on each of the buttons displayed would take the user to the corresponding page.
    
    Design Section-1.png
    
    The design section has changed a bit, rather than accessing this page and the scrolling through all of the designs, designs will be broken up into two sections: general design and IxD Process. Users would click on the section that they desire, and then be able to view the designs on those pages.
    
    Blog Section-1.png
    
    The blog pages would function very similarly to the design pages. Users would click on which blog that they would want to view, and then that would take them to that blog's specific page.
    
    Essay Section-1.png
    
    The essay section would function exactly like how the blogs section functions.
    
    Profile and Portfolio Page-1.png
    
    The profile and portfolio section would function the same too.
