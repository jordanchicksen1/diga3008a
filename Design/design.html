            Below are the links to my design pages. 
            The goal of this page is to display how I rationalize design and structure. It is how critical thinking, practical skills and aesthetic taste come together to create a deisgn philosophy. 
            Planning, work-in-progress designs and wireframes are hosted on these pages, accompanied by some rough, in the moment, explanations.
