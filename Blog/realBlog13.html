ETHICAL INTERNET
</h2>
</br>
<p>
  To me, an ethical internet is a connecting tool that would be accessible to everyone that doesn’t infringe on anyone’s rights or exploit anyone. These are the 3 most important factors for an ideal internet experiences:
</p>
</br>

<h3 class = "longer">
1. EVERYONE, AGES 18 AND UP, HAS FREE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET. 
</h3>
</br>
<p>
    Internet connection could be provided by governments around the world, and not by privatised companies. Private internet companies would be absorbed by governments, so all of the staff would keep their jobs, and everything would run at a similar level of efficiency. Internet connection bills would be built into everyone’s taxes.
</p>
</br>

<p>
    In terms of actual coding practices, I have created systems that fall in line with how western systems are created. Navigational features like navbars are a common design practice that is used globally, but something like having blogs each on their own page is a system that is influenced by the west. I say this because it is not inclusive to make viewers access multiple pages to experience all of the content on my site, as it is not data-friendly for them to have to load multiple pages. 
</p>
</br>
<p>
    The only real barrier to entry to accessing the internet would be hardware, but tech companies like Samsung and Mobicell have created many entry level devices that are relatively affordable, and make this issue much easier to overcome. 
</p>
</br>


<h3 class="longer">
   2. LOWER BARRIER TO ENTRY TO WORKING IN TECH SPACES.
</h3>
</br>
<p>
    Ensuring that more people are able to work in tech means that we will have more technologies and spaces that cater to the needs and circumstances of many, not just the needs and circumstances of western society. 
</p>
</br>
<p>
However, if more people are able to create internet spaces, this would require more monitoring, to make sure that spaces that accommodate for hatred of any kind are not being created too.
</p>
</br>
<h3 class = "longer">
    3. CHANGING THE WAY THAT THE INTERNET REWARDS DIFFERENT BEHAVIOURS. 
</h3>
<p class="filler">

</p>
<p>
Nowadays, a lot of different platforms like X and Youtube seem to reward users who create posts that gain lots of traction, however, it doesn’t matter if this traction is good or bad. Due to this, people create ragebait posts, to make people angry and want to react poorly to their fake opinions. This only makes negative posts more popular, therefore spreading negativity. 
</p>
</br>

<p>
If there was some sort of moderation system that would assess why particular posts are popular, and determine whether their popularity has been created in good faith, this could help reduce this issue. Posts that are popular because of their negativity should be penalized, to discourage behaviour like that.
