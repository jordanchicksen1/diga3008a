            Below are the links to my design pages.

            The goal of this page is to display myself in a way that is appealing to employers. I would like them to see my critical thinking skills, my design philosophies, and my practical skills when creating art. Yes, we are being assigned to do this website, but it is a great tool to display what we are capable of when it comes to creating, organizing and understanding digital arts.
