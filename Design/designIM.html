<p>
  We were tasked with creating a style guide for a fictional book publishing company: Djobela Press. They publish the African Fantasy novel series Djobela's Guardians, which is inspired by Xhosa mythology. 
</p>
<p>
  We wanted to create a style guide that displayed the company's cultural influences. This manifested in the colour palettes chosen.
</p>
<p>
  However, we also wanted to display the company's focus on publish African Fantasy Literature. This manifested in our font choices, and how some buttons on the page are trapezium-shaped, which is a reference to Table Mountain. This is because of how the Djobela Guardians novels focus on the story of Qamata and Table Mountain.
