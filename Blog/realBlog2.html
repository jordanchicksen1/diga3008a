        Reflecting on Stuart Mouthrop text:
    
</h3>
<p>
    Stuart Mouthrop's text You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media (2003) critiques hypertext as a form of sharing digital information. Mouthrop's critique not necessarily correct, as the internet has become such a large space that it is a decentralized space, which is built off participatory knowledge creation. An example of a popular site that exemplifies these characteristics is Wikipedia.
</p>
<p>
    At the time that it was written, his critique could've been accurate, as less people knew how to create space on the internet. Those who knew the ins and outs on internet infrastructure were employed by corporations to create spaces for them. However, in this day and age, information about internet infrastructure is much more accessible to the average person, which has led to more people being able to create their own internet spaces. Mouthrop's text didn't consider that the users of hypermedia would learn and adapt to the system that they were interacting with.

<h4>
    Interaction and the www:
</h4>
<p>
    Interaction to me is creating the conventions and space for your user to explore what you have created.  It is fundamental to the technology as a whole for me. Systems without the space for users, ones that are built to run without human interaction don't even feel like technology to me. The just feel like attributes of an environment, they blend in to the point where I almost don't even notice them. An example of this are streetlights.
