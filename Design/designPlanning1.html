        Implementation
    </h3>


   <h4>
    Goal Alignment:
   </h4> 
    </br>
   <p>
    My users would hopefully be potential collaborators or employers. What those users would be able to do is view the art that I create, and be able to contact me regarding that art if they so please. The content on the site would be artworks and writing pieces that I have completed so far.
   </p>
  
   <h4>
    Information structure
   </h4>
    </br>
  <p>
    I have created a mind map and a flow diagram to display how the different pages of my website are linked and how they flow together. This displays the page dependancies.
  </p>
   
  <h4>
    User Flow
  </h4>
   </br>
   <p>
    Users will have to press a button (with the page's name on it) to access each page. They will never find themself on a page by accident. Clicking on a page's corresponding button would take it to the page itself. Each sepaate component would have its own page, for example, clicking on blogs would take users to the blog homepage (which is it's own page). From there, users would click on the blog that they want to read, which would take them to that specific blog's page.
   </p>
    
    <h4>
     Interface elements
    </h4>
     </br>
    <p>
    Each page should have things to interact with, so that its not just read or viewing. An idea that I've been having is to create a character that hides somewhere on each page, and users would find them by exploring the page. Once they have found them, they can click on them and then there would be a small celebratory segment (like confetti showering the screen or something like that) to denote that they've found them. It would be like Where's Wally or Find Mii from Wii Play.
    </p>
    
     
    <h4>
        Design - Style guides and wire frames
    </h4>
     </br>
   <p>
    For this section, I have created visual mockups based on my wireframes to display what the page would look like. This includes the colour palette, fonts used and button designs. Each section has it's own colour scheme, with secondary colours that are consistent throughout the site.
    Design philosphy-wise, I only want each page to only contain the most essential interactable options for users. I want the page to minimalistic in aesthetic and options to not visually overload the user. This will make the content I do have on the page more meaningful, as it is what is there for them to see. Nothing more, nothing less.

    </p>
    <p>
        The central hub of the entire site. This is where users will be able to access all of the different sections that the site has to offer. I want this to be as transparent as possible, meaning that it shouldn't be cluttered with anything unnecessary to the site like personal information.
    </p>

        <h4>

        <p class="filler">

        </p>
        <p>
            The space to access blogs. This should mimic the design sense of the homepage, as it is like a mini homepage, just for the blogs. This space is updated everytime a blog is added to the site, as users wouldn't be able to access that blog without it.
        </p>

    <p class="filler">

    </p>
    <p>
        What each blog page will look like. In a sense, they mimic the aesthetics of messaging applications like iMessage or Instagram Direct Messages. It's like this because I wanted my site to feel like I was talking directly to users.
    </p>

        <p class="filler">

        </p>
        <p>
            The space to access essays. This should mimic the design sense of the homepage, as it is like a mini homepage, just for the essays (much like the blogs set up). This space is updated everytime an essay is added to the site, as users wouldn't be able to access that essay without it.

        <h4>

        </p>
        <p>
            What each essay page will look like. Much like the blogs, they mimic the aesthetics of messaging applications like iMessage or Instagram Direct Messages. Again, it's like this because I wanted my site to feel like I was talking directly to users.

    <p class="filler">

    </p>
    <p>
        The space to access the Design page, IxD Process page and Planning pages. Again, this should mimic the design sense of the homepage, as it is like a mini homepage, just for the different design sections. This space is updated everytime my designs change, to detail my process.
    </p>

        <p class="filler">

        </p> 
        <p>
            What each design page will look like. Similar to other content pages, they mimic the aesthetics of messaging applications like iMessage or Instagram Direct Messages. Again, it's like this because I wanted my site to feel like I was talking directly to users.

        <p class="filler">

        </p>
        <p>
            The space to access my profile and portfolio pages. Again, this will mimic the design of the other home pages. These pages hold information about me and displays some of the work that I've done.
        </p>
     </section>
    
   <section>
    <h4>
        Individual Profile/Portfolio Page

    <img src = "../images/profile page.jpg" width = "400" height = "200" alt = "an image of what I wanted my profile or portfolio pages to look like individually">
    <p class="filler">

    </p>
    <p>
        What each page will look like. They too will mimic the design of messaging applications. This is especially important on these pages because the information is about me, so it makes it all feel more personal.

    Navigation is smooth, everything you need to access is always close by. Strong branding comes through with the colour palette. The way updates (like new games or sales) are displayed makes it feel like the site always has something new to offer.
   </p>

    <h4>
        What I don't like:
    </h4>
    
    <p class="filler">

    </p>
    <p>
        It often feels a bit too busy. The text is a bit too small. If there are a lot of updates, it can feel like information overload. I also don't necessarily like the inconsistency in terms of whether elements of the pages are more vertical or horizontal.
