    <h3><font color="#000080"><center>My experience with Github and publishing to Pages</center></font></h3>
    <p>
    I don't think I would've been able to do it without the guide provided for us. 
    </p>
    <p>
    It isn't necessarily an intuitive process, but nothing involving Github ever really is. 
    </p>
    <p>
    However, this process will become second nature for all of us just like how setting up a Github for a game and commiting for that changes is.

    <h3><font color="#000080"><center>Reflection on some readings</center></font></h3>
    <h4><font color="grey">As We May Think - Bush, 1945</font></h4>
    <P>
    Bush's idea of a "Memex", the desk for individual use that contains an ever expanding network of knowledge that is held together through references is interesting.
    </P>
    <p>
    It's interesting not necessarily becuase it exists for us now (in the forms of Wikipedia and the internet at large) and is easily accessible for most people in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
    It is interesting to me because it displays how the aesthetics archiving have change over the years. In 1945, archiving anything took up lots of space in our physical world. Whether it was digitally on servers, or physically with books, saving knowledge or data required rooms and buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
    To step away from the internet for one moment, in 1956, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM_magnetic_disk_drives#IBM_350">this is what saving 3.75mb looked like</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Nowadays, we can save 2TB of storage on SD Cards that are the size of the average person's fingernail, let alone a full desk like how Bush imagined it.
    </p>
    <p>
    However, files don't even need to be stored locally anymore for people to access information that they want. It's interesting that Bush came so close to imagine the internet as it is today, but I think what we have now is even better than what he could've imagined.
    </p>

    <h4><font color="grey">Web 2.0</font></h4>
    <p>This term was coined in the late 1990s, with the idea being that the internet was moving away from having all content being created by organisations or corporations, but rather that content should also be created by users.</p>
    <p>This has manifested into the current situation that we have with the internet today, specifically in the 2020s. More content is generated by users than it ever has before, which is seen in the array of social media platforms that we all have access to, like TikTok or Instagram</p>
    <p>Nowadays, corporations even team up with users to create content, with brand deals, as it is a mutually beneficial exchange for both sides.</p>
    <p>This idea leans into Bush's concept of allowing the Memex to be editable, and for each person with access to the Memex being able to add their own information to it. However, it is even more important to the internet than Bush descirbed it for the Memex.</p>
    <p>Without user generated content, the largest websites that we have (social media platforms) would cease to exist. Try imagining Tiktok or Youtube if they were only filled with content created by corporations.</p>
    <div></div>
    <h3><font color="#000080"><center>Interesting things that I've learned about the internet</center></font></h3>
    <p> As discussed above, its quite interesting to see that people were yearning for the spaces that the internet provided long before it was possible.</p>
    <p>It's nice to see how those ideas were realized, but not exactly in the way that they were thought of initially. The were realized in ways that were shaped to the lifestyle of the modern man.</p>
    <p>In turn, the modern man became shaped by the internet.</p>
