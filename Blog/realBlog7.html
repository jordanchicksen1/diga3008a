    <h1>
            
                Week 7 Blog Post
            
    </h1>

    Example 1:

    Nintendo Store Sandton
    
    https://store.nintendo.co.za/?srsltid=AfmBOooNt5XpnDsQR4CB65eO0ZI25Os7oXsnFXkhrPv_6z0wLKbHCzH_Links to an external site.
    
    Pros:
    
    Easily navigable to all of the different pages
    Colour palette that is easy on the eyes, yet still highlights important features.
    Buttons and links are easily clickable and viewable.
    Cons:
    
    It's a little busy
    So elements seem redundant, it almost feels like there are too many ways to access the same page. However it is convenient.
    Sometimes, animations can be a little distracting.
