TEXT ANALYSIS: THE DIGITAL DIVIDE
</h2>
</br>
<p>
   Ruiu and Ragnedda’s text, Theorizing Digital Divides (2017) contains a chapter that details how social capital and the digital divide are linked. It serves as a great resource for learning about both of those topics, whilst serving as a reminder that the rich get richer and the poor stay poor, regardless of the amount of effort that the poor put in to better their conditions. It shows that inequality is an issue that goes beyond what the average joe can fix, and requires help from those that have much more resources than them.
</p>
</br>

<p>
    The text begins by outlining the three different levels of the digital divide: Access, Digital Skills and Usage, and Outcomes and Benefits. Access refers to one’s resources, what technologies that they have available to them. Digital Skills and Usage refers to one’s knowledge, how literate they are with the technology available to them. Lastly, Outcomes and Benefits refers to one’s opportunity, how worthwhile having access and literacy to different technologies is to them (Ruiu and Ragnedda, 2017) . This is a great framework that displays how inequality is an issue that has an impact on many factors. A population may have access to different technologies, yet they may lack the technological literacy to use that technology effectively. A population may have access to different technologies and the technological literacy to use them effectively, yet they still may lack the infrastructure to make that use of technology beneficial to them. With the rise of Generative AI technology, one could posit that South Africans have the access and knowledge to use this technology, but may lack a reason to use it, as our market isn’t set up in a way that requires it.</p>
</br>

<p>
    From this, the text went on to discuss social capital. Social capital could be described as the ability to attain any form of resource through some sort of personal connection. When discussing this through the lens of technology and populations, different populations may not be able to access different technologies because they don’t have some sort of connection to developers of that technology. An example of this in our country can be physical video games and video game consoles. As a country, we gain access to these technologies (amongst others like smartphones) through the EU. This is only possible because we have a good enough relationship with the EU. However, some other African countries, like Zimbabwe, don’t have as good of a relationship with countries like the EU, so they lose access to those technologies. The text breaks down the different types of social capital, which are: bonding social capital and bridging social capital. Bonding social capital is used to describe relationships that are more close-knit and familial. Bridging social capital is used to describe relationships that are much looser, or professional. Bonding social capital allows for information and knowledge to be shared much more freely and quicker than bridging social capital (Ruiu and Ragnedda, 2017).</p>
</br>

<p>
    Why does this distinction matter? And how does it impact the digital divide? Ruiu and Ragnedda explain that having a higher, or more meaningful social capital can aid in the development of a population, in terms of access, technological knowledge and benefits from technological use. However, engaging with different internet technologies can strengthen both bonding and bridging technologies, as it serves as another touchpoint for people to connect through. In our context, and globally, this notion clearly occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. Forcing people to do things online made them become more technologically literate, as it was a necessity. However, unlike how Ruiu and Ragnedda expressed in their text, media literacy was not promoted. Due to this, misinformation and disinformation have become more rampant online, as there is a wider user base for internet technologies. More access to internet technologies means that more people who want to deceive others are online, and more people who are susceptible to misleading are online too. </p>
</br>

<p>
    This text helps to outline the intricacies of the digital divide, so that we can aid in fixing it. Before reading this text, the digital divide seemed like it was only an issue of access, however, only giving a population the newest digital tools doesn’t ensure that they know how to use them effectively. A population knowing how to use digital tools effectively doesn’t ensure that their market is receptive to what can be accomplished by those tools.</p>
