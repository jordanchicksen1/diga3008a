    <p>
        The aesthetic that I'm looking to emulate has a clean cut style. It's one that mimics the OS' of video game consoles like the Nintendo Wii or the Wii U.

    What I'm taking away from my inspiration:
    
    Button and Icon design
    Colour consistency
    General placement of icons and buttons
    Font styling 
    Colour swatches:
    
    The colours that I have thought to use are as follows:
    
    White
    
    Hex code: #FFFFFF
    
    Mainly used for backgrounds or accents
    
     
    
    Grey
    
    Hex code: #D9D9D9
    
    Secondary colour for backgrounds
    
     
    
    Red
    
    Hex code: #FF5757
    
    Used to denote my essay section
    
     
    
    Blue
    
    Hex code: #004AAD
    
    Used to denote my portfolio section
    
     
    
    Yellow
    
    Hex code: #FFDE59
    
    Used to denote my blog section
    
     
    
    Green
    
    Hex code: #00BF63
    
    Used to denote my design section
    
     
    
    Font samples:
    
    I'm quite fond of the font Horizon from Canva for my headings, and the font Anonymous Pro from Canva for my body text.
    
    Horizon:

    Anonymous Pro:

    I like these because they have a clean and simple design, and I'd argue that they have good readability. If these fonts are not available, I will try to find google fonts that look the closest to these.

    For the homepage, each section would be interactable. Clicking on each of the buttons displayed would take the user to the corresponding page.
    
    Design Section-1.png
    
    The design section has changed a bit, rather than accessing this page and the scrolling through all of the designs, designs will be broken up into two sections: general design and IxD Process. Users would click on the section that they desire, and then be able to view the designs on those pages.
    
    Blog Section-1.png
    
    The blog pages would function very similarly to the design pages. Users would click on which blog that they would want to view, and then that would take them to that blog's specific page.

    The essay section would function exactly like how the blogs section functions.
    
    Profile and Portfolio Page-1.png
    
    The profile and portfolio section would function the same too.
