<h1>Style Guide Exercise</h1>

<img src = "../images/Screenshot 2025-03-12 115606.png" width = "350" height = "500">

<p>
  We were tasked with creating a style guide for a fictional book publishing company: Djobela Press. They publish the African Fantasy novel series Djobela's Guardians, which is inspired by Xhosa mythology. 
</p>
<p>
  We wanted to create a style guide that displayed the company's cultural influences. This manifested in the colour palettes chosen.
</p>
<p>
  However, we also wanted to display the company's focus on publish African Fantasy Literature. This manifested in our font choices, and how some buttons on the page are trapezium-shaped, which is a reference to Table Mountain. This is because of how the Djobela Guardians novels focus on the story of Qamata and Table Mountain.

  <h3>
    What I like:
  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Navigation is smooth, everything you need to access is always close by.
    </li>
    <li>
      Strong branding comes through with the colour palette.
    </li>
    <li>
      The way updates (like new games or sales) are displayed makes it feel like the site always has something new to offer.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    What I don't like:
  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      It often feels a bit too busy.
    </li>
    <li>
      The text is a bit too small.
    </li>
    <li>
      If there are a lot of updates, it can feel like information overload.
    </li>
  </ul>
