 Outlining key terms:
</h2>
</br>
<p>
Before beginning this discussion, it would be worthwhile to  outline the definitions of some of the key terms that will be used in this discussion.  
</p>
</br>
<h3 class = "shorter">
    Alignment
</h3>
</br>
<p>
    To articulate a goal in a succinct and simple way, and to make it achievable. An explanation of what my site is supposed to achieve and how I'm going to do that.
</p>
</br>
<h3 class="shorter">
    User:
</h3>
</br>
<p>
    A person who visits the site, who the site is made for. The target audience of the site. I need to cater my site to this audience, to make it as appealing to them as possible.
</p>
</br>

<p>
    Therefore, user alignment would who would be visiting my site and what would they be doing. 
    My users would hopefully be potential collaborators or employers. What those users would be able to do is view the art that I create, and be able to contact me regarding that art if they so please. 
</p>
<h2 class ="shorter">
    Mapping out my sites content:
</h2>
</br>
<h3 class = "shorter">
    Blogs 
</h3>
</br>
<p>
    These would be more informal thoughts, that are still carefully considered, but not pieces of writing that are mulled over endlessly. Shorter-form writing where I give my quick thoughts on any given topic.
</p>

<h3 class = "shorter">
    Essays 
</h3>
</br>
<p>
    Long-form writing that deals with my thoughts on interactive media, filled with carefully considered opinions and research on any given topic related to interactive media.
</p>

<h3 class = "shorter">
    Design
</h3>
</br>
<p>
    This will display my work-in-progress artworks and/or UI/UX visual updates for this website. It will also display my design process, explaining why the site is set up the way it is and looks the way it does.
</p>
<h3 class = "shorter">
    Profile
</h3>
</br>
<p>
    This will display my contact information, education, attributes and work experience. This gives viewers of my site a better idea of who I am and what I do.
</p>
<h3 class = "shorter">
    Portfolio
</h3>
</br>
<p>
    This will display my released works, specifically my Itch.io page, and the things that I have put on there. It is focused on games, because I want to work in the video games field. I don't really want it to highlight any physical works, as I'm not necessarily interest in creating more physical works.
</p>
</br>
<p>
    Each of these sections will have their own folder, hub page and content pages. This helps the site keep its consistency, and display information clearly to users.
