TEXT ANALYSIS: HOW GEOGRAPHY SHAPES - AND IS SHAPED BY - THE INTERNET
</h2>
</br>
<p class="textMessage">
    Shane Greenstein, Avi Goldfarb and Chris Forman’s journal How Geography Shapes - and Is Shaped by - the Internet (2018), is a text that focuses on mapping the connection between the tangible attributes of our real world locations and what is accessible to us in this digital world. They point out that utilization of the internet has allowed us to bypass barriers like fast communication and physical locations used to meet or share things, however, geographic location is still a very important factor in how much mileage you will get out of the internet’s benefits. Both of these points outline the rest of the text, to detail the points that it will go through, specifically: economic circumstances that is different amongst different geographies, how access is varies across different regions, how the type of area that a region is comprised of impacts internet access (whether it is urban or rural), the economic impact that the internet creates, and lastly, how new technologies will impact future internet research.
</p>
</br>

<p class="textMessage">
    In terms of economic circumstances of different geographies, new internet infrastructure and means of interaction have become more accessible, due to decreases in their cost  over time. Internet based communication, research and a lack of need for transportation has saved countries lots of money, whilst still providing the equivalent or better methods than what would’ve been possible without the internet. Communication without the internet would take much longer and cost much more money. Research without the internet would cost more, and may not be up to date on global standards. This is all well and good for geographies with great internet access, but it makes geographies that cannot access the internet reliably fall  behind in terms of effectiveness and widens the digital divide.
</p>
</br>

<p class="textMessage">
    In geographies with better internet literacy/technology infrastructure, internet access allows those populations to work quicker as they can utilize internet tools to aid in productivity. This, in turn, allows for users to gain different needs that can only be met with work aided by internet utilization. However, places that don’t rely on internet based work may experience slower yet more reliable outcomes from businesses.Regardless, efficiency often can matter more than high quality. When discussing software solutions, its better to make something exist first and then make it good later.

    This leads into their next point, as the frequent internet access allows for a geographic-wide reliance on the internet, it becomes a part of the ecosystem of the geography that utilizes it. This evolves that population, making technology an extension of their being. Essentially, this develops urban areas at a faster pace and makes it harder for rural areas to catch up in terms of development. Again, furthering the digital divide.
</p>
</br>

<p class="textMessage" >
    In essence, all of the points above have echoed a singular idea: the internet changes geographies that interact with them. It develops them at a fast pace, and makes them reliant on the technology. However, geographies that are late to this development can’t catch up at the same development pace as the geographies that have already had internet access. To synthesise this, this follows the logic that the rich get richer and the poor stay poor.
</p>
</br>

<p class="textMessage" >
    However, it is not a truly lost cause. Internet equality laws can help less developed areas get a leg up in the situation. Even though the digital divide widens every year that developed areas have access to the newest technology, the technology could ebb and flow, where it has periods where it plateaus. This gives developing areas time to catch up to developing areas. 
</p>
</br>

<p class="textMessage">
    This text is quite bleak, but it gives readers a fair assessment of the situation that we find ourselves in. It tackles the topic of the digital divide, and breaks it down to its most fundamental characteristics: economic inequalities and development inequalities. Its vital to outline key issues in our system if we are going to fix it.
