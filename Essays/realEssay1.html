    ESSAY 1: Ethics of UI and UX
</h1>
</br>
<p> 
Juned Ghanchi’s text, Ethical Design: Why Is It Critical for UX Designers? (2021),
states that the work of designers is a reflection of their opinions and notions, whether
it is on purpose or not. This is why ethics are an important topic for designers to
engage with, as it is an underlying tenant that upholds their work, more so than any
learned aesthetic theories. Using this line of thinking, this essay will analyse the
ethical choices of a website that sells products to South Africans, Nintendo Store
Sandton. This entails analysing its UI and UX practices and discussing the morals of
its interaction design. This will be aided by discussions on Arunesh Mathur et al’s
text, Dark Patterns at Scale: Findings from a Crawl of 11k Shopping Websites (2019)
and Aparna K.S.’ text, Ethical UX Design Best Practices: A Comprehensive Guide
(2024). It will be worthwhile to begin by discussing what morally correct UX design
looks like.
</p>
</br>
<p>
Aparna K.S. defines ethical user experience design as the creation of user experiences that have a respect for users’ free will, sensitive data and general well-being. Ethical UX doesn’t manipulate or coerce the user into doing anything that they don’t want to do, such as purchasing unnecessary products or services, being unable to cancel subscription services, or exposing their personal data. This method of UX design is important not only because it is the morally correct thing to do, but in terms of business, it allows users to trust your platform more, it makes your brand look better and it falls in line with laws regarding internet privacy (K.S., 2024). With that last point, larger software companies like Google and Apple have set up conventions that respect user privacy, so it’s not so hard to fall in line with what is popular. K.S. displayed some principles for users to follow, such as clearly communicating platform intentions (so to not mislead users), only collecting necessary information from users and explicitly stating what data will be collected, and making it easy for users to choose whether to opt out of your services if they do not want their information to be accessible to your platform. In short, clear and truthful communication between users and platforms is key. However, there are some issues for designers and engineers when it comes to ethical design, specifically with AIs and automation (K.S., 2024). If designers are not considerate of their biases, they will implement them into their work (specifically) without even realizing it. Biases of algorithms can go undetected by platform holders, until the site or app is available to the general public, which is already too late. Aside from this,

there are many sites out there that house blatantly unethical designs that are built to deceive users for monetary gain.
</p>
</br>
<p>
    Mathur et al detail data that they had scraped from eleven thousand websites, explaining the most common uses of unethical designs in those sites. Techniques such as false urgency (making users believe products are selling out fast) and fake social corroboration (stating that many users have just bought the product that you are viewing) are used to pressure users into feeling like it is necessary to buy a platform’s product. Other techniques like obstructing users (making it harder for them to complete tasks like cancelling subscriptions) and sneaking (adding products to a user’s cart without their knowledge) coerce users into unknowingly spending money on products or services (Mathur et al, 2019). Actions like the ones stated above are exploitative of the user, often without them even knowing, which reflects badly on the internet based business as a whole. It makes users question “Is this site legitimate?” or “Am I going to get scammed on this site?” everytime they want to buy something from a site that they haven’t used or heard of before. Due to this, sites like hellopeter.com were created for people to express their concerns about certain sites or complain about sites that they had gotten scammed on. In an ideal world, where all designers didn’t implement unethical UX practices, sites like hellopeter.com wouldn’t have to exist. However, it is worth noting that only 15% of the sites examined had employed these techniques, even if it was only one technique, so the problem is not particularly widespread, even though it still exists and plagues the internet (Mathur et al, 2019). On that note, it would be worthwhile to discuss a site that doesn’t employ these harmful techniques, one that upholds ethical UX design.

    Nintendo Store Sandton websites’ purpose is to sell and market goods made by Nintendo to all South Africans, whether it is online or in person. It displays what products are available for purchase, and details all of the products’ different components. Some examples of the goods housed on their sites are video games and consoles, but merchandise such as shirts and plushies are also available. Upon entering the site, users are met with a banner that they can slide through. It displays the newest or most important products, and is updated whenever they want to highlight something. Users can then scroll down and see secondary services provided by the site, such as technical support, delivery, payment plans, bundle deals and parental controls. After this section, there are more banners that categorise the products into their different collections, such as consoles, video games, accessories, etc. Lastly, supplemental information such as contact details, customer support and information about the company is placed at the bottom of the site. However, an element that anchors the whole site is the navigation bar that is ever present on the site. It allows users to search for products (whether it is by category, franchise or specifically by name), access the items that they’ve added to their cart, access the organization’s contact details and access bars that provide access points to all of the different categories. It provides everything that the homepage itself provides in one helpful bar. Aside from this, the other pages hosted by the site are the different product pages, and a profile page to catalogue purchases and delivery location. This site is interesting, as it has multiple audiences to market to and do business with, such as young kids who want to play video games, adults who want to play and purchase video games, and adults who don’t play video games but still want to purchase them for others. Therefore, the designers have to instill features and communications that a broad range of people will understand, which is why there are multiple different ways to access the same information/pages. The main goal of this site is to sell products, so the designers have made it as easy as possible for users to have the ability to access these products. The site houses many products which can be overwhelming for some viewers, especially if they are younger or older. However, the compartmentalization of the products has made it more digestible for them, which makes users more likely to purchase products. However, all of these design methods may not be the idea of the South African designers, rather, they may be emblematic of Nintendo’s own company ideology. In terms of the site’s ethical practices, the site doesn’t bombard the user with pop ups asking for permission to access their information. It doesn’t use scarcity tactics or deceive the user into buying things. There are no subscription services, or any form of locking users into monthly payments that they cannot opt out of. It doesn’t ask for any user information (for marketing purposes or any other reason) unless the user is purchasing a product from the site, which is mainly used so that purchases can be logged or delivered. All it does is display what is available for purchase, and allow the user to truly decide whether they want to purchase any products or not. The site does have the luxury of housing products that people already know of and are fans of, so they don’t have to do as rigorous work in terms of selling users the idea of their products (like other sites may have to), they display what is on offer at face value. Due to these sound ethical practices, users are more trusting of this site, as they can tell that there is no foul play at hand. Gaining user trust will make a platform more successful overall.

    Therefore, with all of the information provided above, it is clear that ethical UX design is an important pillar of design that shouldn’t be overlooked. It is arguably more important than any aesthetic choices made by designers. K.S’ text detailed what ethical design should look like, whilst Mathur et al’s text displayed the many ways that users are tricked or coerced by unethical UX design. Understanding both methods of design allows us to see that there are still many sites that uphold ethical UX design values, and those sites earn their users’ trust because of this (which is seen with the Nintendo Store Sandton’s site). Teaching budding designers these design values can hopefully allow them to create experiences that users trust, without any sort of manipulation.
