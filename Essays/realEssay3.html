    Overview
</h3>
</br>

<p class="textMessage"> 
Overall, my site is functional and gets my messages across. However, there are
many aspects of web development that I need to work on. Being a backend
developer is not my strength, as the elements that viewers will see and interact with
are what’s most important to me. I understand that I need to work hard on cleaning
my code and making sure that my files and folder structure are readable and
understandable for others. Especially if I had to work on a team of web developers.
</p>
</br>
<h3 class = "shorter">
    Folder Structure
</h3>
</br>
<p class="textMessage">
My folder structure is logical and understandable for the most part. Most HTML files
of different types have their own folders, most CSS files are in their own folder, and
all Javascript files are in their own folder. The only files that aren’t in folders are the
index.html file, the homepage.css, normalize.css and main.css files. These files
aren’t in a folder because they have global interactions for the whole site, or are the
basis for the site.
</p>
</br>
<p class="textMessage">
   With the structure I have, this system is scalable and its quite easy to add files and
folders in or take them away. Most things are in their own compartment. Also, the
naming conventions make sense to me. For example, any html file with blog in its
name needs to be in the blog folder. If a blog file was in an essay folder, I’d be able
to pick that up or fix it easily.
</p>
</br>
<p class="textMessage">
    However, the system can be tweaked a bit to be cleaner, specifically the files that
aren’t in folders.
</p>

<h3 class = "shorter">
    Semantic Markup
</h3>
</br>
<p class="textMessage">
My semantic markup needs some work. More things need to be labelled to give my
user more information about the content that they’re interacting with. Micro
formatting is a section that I didn’t really understand about web development until
very close to the end of this semester. Due to this, my pages exist as information that
makes sense for these assignments, but not for a public website that users outside
of this degree would interact with. However, I did add h-cards under Iman's guidance, so there are still displays of microformatting.
</p>

</br>
<p class="textMessage">
Semantic markup is something that I need to get better at as this course goes on, as
it improves any site’s visibility in terms of Search Engine Optimization. If no one can
find your site, your site just doesn’t exist to a large amount of people.
</p>

</br>
<p class="textMessage">
Semantic markup can improve accessibility for users that are visually impaired, so I
did make sure to try and label everything I could think of so that it could be interacted
with by those with screen readers.
</p>

<h3 class = "shorter">
    Metadata
</h3>
</br>

<p class="textMessage">
    Metadata is a section of the site that wasn’t too bad, as each page is labelled
thoroughly in the head, specifically with the tags “author”, “description”, and
“keywords”. However, I do understand that the tag “keywords” isn’t a tag that I will
consistently use as it has been abused by sites trying to become popular by using
tags that don’t apply to the site, so that they show up in more search engine results.
</p>
</br>
<p class="textMessage" >
    In the body section, I made sure that all of my images had alt tags for captions.
However, I could add more metadata to my body, to denote what different sections of
text are, such as replacing divs with more article tags. I also would’ve liked to
implement lists in a more meaningful way, but decided not to for aesthetic purposes.
The backgrounds of lists went against my site’s aesthetic consistency, so most of the
lists that I had turned into formatted paragraphs.
</p>

<h3 class = "shorter">
    Cascading Style Sheets
</h3>
</br>

<p class="textMessage"> 
    CSS was quite a hard section for me to grasp, due to the myriad methods of editing
the look of elements on the page, which led me to figure things out by fiddling with
them until it looked right. However, this led me to edit aspects of pages and classes
through multiple methods, and I kept on getting confused at which lines of code
impacted what part of the designs. Due to this, there are probably lines of code that
are redundant on my page.
</p>
</br>
<p class="textMessage">
    I tried my best to avoid in-line styling, however the specific times that it felt like I
should use it was with the sizes of images. Other than that, there shouldn’t be any in-
line styling in my stylesheets.
</p>
</br>
<p class="textMessage">
    The code is modular to a degree, as I can tweak things whenever I need to, but it
takes more effort than it should. Whenever I need to edit my CSS, I need to try doing
things a couple of times before I reach my desired result, which isn’t great.
</p>
</br>
<p class="textMessage">
    Responsiveness is also a sore spot for my site, as I couldn’t get things to display
exactly how I wanted them to for mobile devices. I did try to though, especially by
using percentages for the sizes of some elements instead of pixels.
</p>

<h3 class = "shorter">
    Javascript
</h3>
</br>
<p class="textMessage">
    Javascript was the best part of creating this site, as most of the time, the things I
tried to do just worked in the way that I thought that they would. I think it’s because
Javascript is similar to C# in some aspects (like syntax and logic), which I’m quite
familiar with fortunately. In the future, I want to expand the things that I do with
Javascript, specially making games on the sites I create using JS. However, much
like the rest of the issues I have understanding web development, that will take lots
of time and learning.
</p>
</br>

<p class="textMessage"> 
    Javascript was used mainly for features that livened up the site, but were not
extremely necessary, like the back-to-top button, screen transition, lightboxes, and
API-related feature. None of these features make or break the site, but the site is
better with them present. All of these functions (apart from the API-related feature)
are used on almost every page of the site, so their effects are quite noticeable to
viewers. 
</p>
</br>

<p class="textMessage">
    I did make sure to not use any in-line scripting, and only linked to the scripts and had
their functionality on their specific scripts. However, I didn’t see the need to use
async requests for my JS functions. All of them were quite low-burden. All of the
internet connections I tested them on worked the same, no matter how fast or slow
the connection was. However, I do understand that for other more intense functions,
async requests will need to used.
I'm interested in using Javascript to create more segments in my sites, this is where the best interactions occur on my site and I want to make them even better in the future. I aim to create small web games with Javascript.
