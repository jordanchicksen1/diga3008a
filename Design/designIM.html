  We were tasked with creating a style guide for a fictional book publishing company: Djobela Press. They publish the African Fantasy novel series Djobela's Guardians, which is inspired by Xhosa mythology. We wanted to create a style guide that displayed the company's cultural influences. This manifested in the colour palettes chosen. However, we also wanted to display the company's focus on publish African Fantasy Literature. This manifested in our font choices, and how some buttons on the page are trapezium-shaped, which is a reference to Table Mountain. This is because of how the Djobela Guardians novels focus on the story of Qamata and Table Mountain.

    What I like:
  </h3>
  </br>
  <p>
  Navigation is smooth, everything you need to access is always close by. Strong branding comes through with the colour palette. The way updates (like new games or sales) are displayed makes it feel like the site always has something new to offer.
  </p>
      
    
  <h3 class = "shorter">
    What I don't like:
  </h3>
  </br>
  <p>
    It often feels a bit too busy. The text is a bit too small. If there are a lot of updates, it can feel like information overload.
